This game is essentially the result of someone going, “How do I make soccer more American?” The premise of this game is you drive around in super fast race cars, crash into your friends and also try to hit a ball or something. Who cares? More race cars! This game was listed as a top-20 essential party game by Seamus Mullins of PC World. It’s fast pace and car crashing fun make it an entertaining experience that sure to liven up any get together: It's all about getting into the next throttle-pounding match as fast as possible.</p>

<figcaption class="divwidth resp2">The rules are simple: two teams of cars drive really fast around over a dozen glossy, brightly colored arenas doing fancy tricks and smashing an endlessly ricocheting oversized ball into the goal. The satisfying heart of Rocket League very much lives in that arcadey feeling of fluid and unrestricted movement. Serious players have their go-to speedsters!</figcaption>
