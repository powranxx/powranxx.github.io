There are times where you aren’t really willing to commit the next few hours to a game’s story, but still, want to be stimulated in some way. According to an article by Steven Petite of Digital Trends, one of the best puzzle games to pass the time with is a game called “The Witness”. The game is a first-person puzzle game taking place on an island divided into eleven sections. Each puzzle is more difficult from the last that will leave you scratching your head but feeling amazing once you find the solution.</p>
