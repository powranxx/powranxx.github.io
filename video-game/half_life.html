Think back with us, if you will, to a day filled with classes that all somehow manage to make your day terrible. One teacher gave you an 18-page paper due next week, and you just need a way to release that pent-up stress and rage in a way that won’t land you in jail. According to IGN’s list of the top 100 first-person shooters, that game is “Half-Life.” The game was released back in 1998 and has since come out with a whole series where you play Gordon Freeman, a scientist trapped in a facility after an experiment goes awry. Wanna shoot some bad guys.</p>

<figcaption class="divwidth resp2">Few shooters were ever as ambitious and economically designed as Half-Life, but the game stands out more than ever now because the linear, story-driven, single-player shooter hasn’t been a cultural force for years. Half-Life’s formula had clear limits. The game wasn’t self-serious or plot-heavy; its narrative amounts to Gordon Freeman fighting successively bigger monsters.</figcaption>
